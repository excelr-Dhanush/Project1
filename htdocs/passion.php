<h3>
Today is a landmark day for DDRST as we complete 14 years of dedicated patient care. Over the years
DDRST has been he pioneer of healthcare in India, and we are humbled by the love and trust placed in us
  by over 20 million patients and their families. It has motivated us to put in tireless efforts and remain 
  unwavering in our commitment to bring you the best healthcare in the world.<BR>

As we enter our 15th year, I want to re-affirm this commitment - DDRST will always bring you the best
 healthcare in the world, no matter what. This is our mission. Today with over 10,000 beds, 400 clinics,
  5,000 pharmacies , we bring the best, most comprehensive omnichannel care to
   you wherever you are and whenever you need it.<BR>

We have the best doctors and the most care-focused teams coupled with the most advanced equipment,
 cutting-edge treatments and technologies, including Proton therapy, robotic surgeries, artificial intelligence
  and more. These ensure we can get you healthy quickly so you can get back to leading a happy and
   fulfilling life.<BR>

As our country emerges from the pandemic, DDRST will focus its efforts on the NCD epidemic, including diabetes,
 CVD and cancer. Sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy diets have made our youth susceptible to these chronic
  diseases. Over 50% of premature mortality in India in the 30+ age group can be attributed to NCDs.
   India will spend around $5 trillion by 2030 to combat NCDs.<BR>

To become a developed nation, we must first ensure that we are a healthy nation, and DDRST is committed to
 battling the NCD epidemic to ensure the youth of our nation remains healthy and can accelerate our nation’s 
 development.

But there is much more to be done, and I believe we are just getting started. Over the next 4 decades,
 we will work towards making healthcare more proactive and preventive. In fact, our measure of success would 
 be if you never need to visit a hospital at all.<BR>


A system that is proactive and a system that optimises 
quality of life. I believe India, with its heritage of holistic healthcare, can take the lead in providing this
 new system of care to the world. Patients from over 150 countries come to India for treatment that is at par
  with western countries at a fraction of the cost. With the ‘Heal in India’ initiative, I am sure we will have 
  the opportunity to serve many more people from around the world right here in India.<BR>


The entire DDRST family conveys our best wishes to you, and we want to remind you that your life is precious.
 Take care of it and stay healthy.</h3>
